### Overview

Sirato is a data and analytics platform for VMWare Blockchain for Ethereum.

It provides a rich API, and easy to use interface to provide information on the various assets such as tokens, and smart contracts deployed on blockchains. 

### Features

Sirato works by ingesting raw blockchain data and restructuring it to provide information about activity taking place on the blockchain.

This information is presented in its user interface. Sirato provides views of the following blockchain data:

- Accounts
- Blocks
- Transactions
- Smart contracts
- Tokens

By browsing to the relevant tab in Sirato, you are presented with the associated blockchain data.

In addition you can use its search functionality to locate specific accounts, blocks, transactions or contracts by their address or hash.
