# ERC20 Test Tool

An application designed to test the ERC-20 token transfer functionality. This provides a quick way to test a new blockchain. This test application will deploy a sample ERC-20 contract and then tranfer tokens between accounts to test the blockchain.

See the [helm-chart/README](./helm-chart/README.md) file for instructions on running this test application.
