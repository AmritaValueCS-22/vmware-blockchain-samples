# VMWare Blockchain Samples

VMware Blockchain is an enterprise-grade blockchain platform that enables multi-party workflows. It uses advanced techniques such as byzantine fault-tolerant state machine replication, authenticated data structures, and integration with smart contract execution engines to enable customers to build and run decentralized multi-party applications.


This repo contains multiple sample examples which will help in bootstapping.
